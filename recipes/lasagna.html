      "[This is] actually quite easy to make for someone who has never made
      lasagna before," according to jimbob2229. "I used ricotta instead of
      cottage cheese and added spinach. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely
      make it again."

      "I didn't have any ground pork in the house, so I omitted that ingredient,
      but it was great with just the beef," says one Allrecipes community
      member. "The sauce came out terrific too, much better than the stuff you
      find in jars."

      "I made this recipe last night and it turned out fabulous," raves Daniel
      Steed. "I did increase the meats and sauce a little for the slightly
      larger pan size, but everyone loved it. I served it with garlic toast and
      green beans for a side."

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
      <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
      <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high
        heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion
        and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
        garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water
        to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh
        parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
        9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
        over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
        the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
        once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and
        mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
        bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and
        serving.
